# Project: Bank account management system
 ![Image Alt text](/image.jpg "Image")
This is a basic bank account management system, created using the concepts of object oriented programming (OOPs) in Python. The defined bank account class could perform some basic bank operations, like deposit, withdraw, interest calculation etc. I am willing to continue work on this project, in order to be able to perform more complex bank operations as well.

I worked on this project as a part of my studying of programming course in SoftUni University, with technical trainer Mario Zahariev. There is link to his GitHub profile https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof.
