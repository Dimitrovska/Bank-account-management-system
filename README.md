# Project: Bank account management system
 ![Image Alt text](/image.jpg "Image")
 
This is a basic bank account management system, created using the concepts of object oriented programming (OOPs) in Python. This project serves as a foundational framework for managing bank accounts efficiently, offering essential functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, interest calculation, and more. I am willing to continue work on this project, in order to be able to perform more complex bank operations as well.

I am working on this project as a part of my studies of Python programming course at SoftUni University, with technical trainer Mario Zahariev.


## Features

- **Account Creation**: Easily create new bank accounts with customizable initial balances.
- **Deposit and Withdrawal**: Perform transactions seamlessly by depositing funds into or withdrawing funds from an account.
- **Interest Calculation**: Automated interest calculation to help users track their earnings over time.


## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the Bank Account Management System provides essential functionalities for basic banking operations, future enhancements are planned to extend its capabilities. Some potential features for future development include:

- **Multi-Account Management**: Support managing multiple accounts within the same system, catering to diverse banking needs.
- **User Authentication**: Integrate user authentication mechanisms to secure access to accounts and enhance privacy.
- **Advanced Banking Operations**: Implement more sophisticated banking operations, such as loan management, account aggregation, and investment tracking.
