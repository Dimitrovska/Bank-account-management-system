# Project: Bank account management system
This is a basic bank account management system, created using the concepts of object oriented programming (OOPs) in Python. The defined bank account class could perform some basic bank operations, like deposit, withdraw, interest calculation etc. I am willing to continue work on this project, in order to be able to perform more complex bank operations as well.
