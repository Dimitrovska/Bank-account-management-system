# Project: Bank account management system
 ![Image Alt text](/image.jpg "Image")
This is a basic bank account management system, created using the concepts of object oriented programming (OOPs) in Python. The defined bank account class could perform some basic bank operations, like deposit, withdraw, interest calculation etc. I am willing to continue work on this project, in order to be able to perform more complex bank operations as well.

I am working on this project as a part of my studies of Python programming course at SoftUni University, with technical trainer Mario Zahariev. Here is a link to his GitHub profile https://github.com/zahariev-webbersof and also, link to the University https://about.softuni.bg/?_gl=1*15w5zl1*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MDYyNjQyNDQuRUFJYUlRb2JDaE1JbzVYQnktbjZnd01WeklSb0NSMFZxZ0F1RUFBWUFTQUFFZ0lHX1BEX0J3RQ..*_gcl_au*MjcxNzY0NDE3LjE3MDU3NjE4MDA.
